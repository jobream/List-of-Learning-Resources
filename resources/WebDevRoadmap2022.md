## Basic Front End
### HTML
### CSS
### For Front-End Developers
Front-end developers work on user interface (UI) — what user interacts with. These developers are expected to work with JavaScript, libraries and frameworks, and various projects. 
### JavaScript
Now, with JavaScript, you’ll need to know:

Debugging (finding and fixing errors)
Functions (the “building blocks” in your program)
Document Object Model (DOM)
User Interface events (i.e., mouse over, mouse down, click, etc.)
Fetch API, and so on.
### Libraries And Frameworks
Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that makes the CSS look nicer and develop faster.
NPM is a package manager for JavaScript, letting you install various packages quickly on a machine.
React is a front-end framework that’s useful for starting web developers.
js helps you in server-side rendering or generating static websites.

### Project Building(Most Important)
There are many tutorials teaching the basics of web development, but there is no greater teacher than real-time experience building projects. It is important to keep your ideal role and company in mind as you determine which projects will help you build a robust portfolio with the skills needed to land your dream job.

A great first project is your portfolio. As a frontend developer you will be able to put your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the test as you build a site that is interactive and reflects your talent.

## What’s Expected of Backend Developers
Backend developing is when you work on the logic part of an application, which communicates with the database and front-end.

### Servers
Servers for backend developing are written in languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, etc. As a result, you’ll get the following backend frameworks to work with:
### Django (Python)
is a framework that helps you develop an application faster, since much of its assets are pre-built.
### Express/ Node (JS)
 is a JavaScript framework that’s easy to learn and implement, and it can be used by any web developer.

 ## Databases
 While there are many Databases to learn about, the most common to learn are:

MySQL
MongoDB
PostgreSQL

## Backend Language To Use
Languages to learn include the following:

Deno.js
Node.js
The complete MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node)

# Conclusion
This roadmap is essential to look through when it comes to web development. As you read through this quick guide, you’ll be able to work towards become a web developer, and entering one of the most lucrative industries to date!
